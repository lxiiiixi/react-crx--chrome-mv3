## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm run start` —— Runs the app in the development mode.

 `npm run build` —— Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

 `npm run watch` —— To avoid running `yarn build` after updating any file, you can run this, which listens to any local file changes, and rebuilds automatically.

## Adding React app extension to Chrome

In Chrome browser, go to `chrome://extensions` page and switch on developer mode. This enables the ability to locally install a Chrome extension.
